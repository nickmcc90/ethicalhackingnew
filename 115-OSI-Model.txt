115-OSI-Model

This is referring to the layers that we were talking about.

Here is a pnumonic to remember it all:

*please do not throw sausage pizza away* lol

1 Physical - data cables, cat6
2 Data - switches, MAC addresses
3 Network - IP addresses, routing
4 Transport - TCP and UDP
5 Session - session management
6 Presentation - WMV, JPEG, MOV (media)
7 Application - HTTP, SMTP

When we receive data, we receive it through the physical, down the list, then through application.
When we transmit data, it is the opposite.
When troubleshooting, it's good to start at the physical level.
