"ifconfig" is a command that allows you to see your ip address.
inet (ipv4) and inet6 (ipv6) are two common ways to display the ip.

inet is comprised of four octets. An octet has 8 bits, so an inet ip address has 32 bits. This equals 4 bytes.

The way that octets work are as follows:

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
1    1  1  0 0 0 1 1        The ones and zeros indicate on and off values. The highest number we can make is 255.
                            With the example shown, our number totals to 128+64+32+2+1 to be 216. An ip address is
                            made up of four of these number combos.


2^32 (since we have 32 bytes) is the amount of possible ip address we can make, supposedly. 4,294,967,296. But there are
seven billion people on this planet, so how can we all have one? This is true, that we need more. ipv4 was made in 1981
and it was never imagined that we would need all this space. So ipv6 comes to the rescue.

ipv6 is 2^128 bits, which is a reeaaaaally long number. You would think that people are using this alternative, but we
aren't! WE STILL USE ipv4!! Why though?

Well, there are things called private IPs. 

*See private-ip-addresses.png*
Class C: Households and small business are suitable to have only 254 hosts.
Class A: Massive businesses use these. Many hosts.

Any IP that isn't private in this category is free game for the public. People usually rent out these numbers.

ipv4, ipv6, and routing are all Layer 3.
