A subnet is the netmask 255.255.255.0 shown above.

<!-- timestamp: 1:14:22 -->

Let's start with the 255.255.255.0, also known as the /24
Hosts: 256.

It is called the /24 because there are 24 bits turned on within 255.255.255.0.
Remember how each section of 255.255.255.0 was called an octet? And within each
octet there is a...

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1                   ....thing like this? There are 8 bits here. So 
1   1   1  1 1 1 1 1    = 255             with since there are three 255 sections in
                                          255.255.255.0, that means its /24. Now if this
                                          was 255.255.254.0, one of the bits was turned off
                                          in the third section so now its a /23. As we turn down
                                          the bits, the amount of hosts get larger and larger.


The subnet is equal to the numerical conversion of the amount of bits that are turned on.
So for a /20, that would have two full octets and four left over in the third octet. So 
for the third octet, it would be 128+64+32+16 = 240. So the network would be 
255.255.240.0

To calculate hosts, you see how many bits are turned off. 12 bits turned off? 2^12 hosts.

Notes: 
Always subtract 2 from host total.
Network ID - First Address
Broadcast - Last Address

So.... for 192.168.1.0/24     
Subnet: 255.255.255.0
Hosts: 254
Network: 192.168.1.0
Broadcast: 192.168.1.255    It's 255 at the end because 0-254 is 255 addresses.
