-----------------SUDO-----------------

Sudo stands for super user do. We can run commands with this line as an elevated user.
The elevated user is a root user.


cat /etc/shadow       This command doesn't get run unless you put 'sudo' in front of it because it is a sensitive file.


In order to switch to the root user we can type:
sudo su -
Which switches us to the root user for just the tab you are in.


-----------NAVIGATING THE FILE SYSTEM-----------------

To see where we are, we can type 'pwd' to see the folder we're in.
To change to a different folder, that's cd.
To change a folder backwards, that's 'cd ..'. Two dots after cd.
To see what's in our current folder, press ls.
We can go right to a directory put typing cd /etc/ from any folder. (Whatever the place is called, doesn't have to be etc.)
We can make a folder by typing mkdir  'filename'.
To remove a folder, rmdir 'filename'.
To see hidden files, type ls -la.
We can move text into a place with: 

echo "hello!" > test.txt
ls
cp test.txt Location/

To remove it:

rm Location/test.txt

To move it (not copy it):

mv test.txt Location/

To find a file:

updatedb
locate 'file'

To change your password: 

passwd        (Then type in a new password)


If you need to refresh your memory on commands:

man 'command name'

To read a file, it's:
cat 'filename'


--------------USERS & PERMISSIONS---------------------

When we press ls -la (this command also shows you permissions), we can see a bunch of files and directories.
The directories start with d, and files start with -.

drwx r-x r-x
The first section is the person who made it's permissions, which is read, write, and execute.
The second section is the people who have access to it in the group's permissions which is read and execute.
The third section is any common user that can read and execute.

As penetration testers, we look for files that have full read write executes to see if we can upload something that
can mess up the function. For example, the /temp/ folder.


If we create a script, a script can't fully run unless we have full access in a place.

We can change permissions on a script by typing chmod 777 'filename'.



We can add users:
adduser
Then, 
adduser 'name'
Then it asks for password,
'type password'.

We can type
cat /etc/passwd     To see all the users.

We can type
cat /etc/shadow     To get the passwords for everyone, then it needs to be run through a password breaker.

We can type
su 'user'         To switch to a user.

If a lower user tries to change the password of the root channel with:
sudo passwd root            They won't be able to.




---------------COMMON NETWORK COMMANDS-------------------

ping 'ip address'       We press Ctrl+C to end this, because this commnad runs forever. Just has a constant stream of communication with ip.

arp -a                This associates ip address with their respective MAC address.

netstat -ano          This opens all things that an ip address is currently doing, so you can see who they're talking to, all that.


route                 This shows all the available ip addresses of the thing you are attacking.
